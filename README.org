#+title: POC Image Anti-cheating
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This is a proof of concept of using an anti-cheating devide based on watermark

* Principle
We sign images with a watermark, that is, we choose a position in the image to change its pixels and saving some metadata, in this POC we choose the MAC address and the time and hour.

The file [[file:signImage.m][signImage.m]] has comments explaining each step

* Creating a obscured function to deliver to students
By running
#+begin_src matlab
pcode signImage
#+end_src
we can create a file signImage.p, which can be delivered with the TP subject.

A complete use case is described in [[file:Example/README.org]]
